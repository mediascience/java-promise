callbacks.

## Versioning

Releases in the 0.x series are the Wild West. Anything can change between
releases--package names, method signatures, behavior, whatever. But if you
like it as it is right now, all the tests pass so just use it at its current
version and have fun.

The next version series will be 1.x. Every release in that series will be
backward compatible with every lower-numbered release in the same series
except possibly in the case of 1) a bug fix or 2) a correction to an
underspecification.

An incompatible change to the interface, behavior, license, or anything else
after the 1.x series is published will result in a new series, such as
2.x.
